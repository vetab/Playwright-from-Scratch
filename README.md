# Playwright-from-Scratch
Playwright with Python setup from Scratch

First step is to install Playwright and to be able to do this the following command has to be executed within the project:

pip install pytest-playwright

Once when that is done the browsers have to be installed using the command:

python -m playwright install (In case if Python3 is in use then python has to be changed with python3 within the command)
